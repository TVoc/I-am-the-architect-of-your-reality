\end{figure}

\subsection{Domain constraints}
In this section we provide additional domain constraints.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Document is only delivered to the Recipient it is addressed to
    \item A Template must have the fields that are mandatory for the document type it is a Template for
    \item A Payslip can only be sent to Employees the Customer Organization employs
    \item If the Customer Organizations outsources Payslip management to a Social Secretary, it cannot submit Payslip data itself
    \item While a Recipient is subscribed to a Personal Document Store, any document for which e-mail is specified as the Distribution Channel is instead delivered through the Personal Document Store
    \item While a Recipient is subscribed to an Online Distribution Platform that is also an external party with respect to eDocs (i.e. not the Personal Document Store), any documents of the type the Online Distribution Platform distributes is sent via the Online Distribution Platform regardless of the Distribution Platform the Customer Organization has selected
    \item If while constructing a Raw Data Entry no individual priority is explicitly selected, the individual priority is the same as the default processing priority of the Customer Organization
    \item An Invoice cannot be its own advance invoice
    \item An Invoice is always addressed to a Client
    \item A Payslip is always addressed to an Employee
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Glossary}
In this section, we provide a glossary of the most important terminology used
in this analysis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Term1}: definition
    \item \textbf{Term2}: definition

		\item The System constructs an e-mail. This e-mail is addressed to the name of the Registered recipient and contains a short description of the received document (i.e. the sender of the document, the type of the document and the date at which the document was sent) and a link to the document.
		\item The System sends this e-mail to the e-mail address of the Registered recipient.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:} 
	None
	
	\item \textbf{Remarks:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  This use case is an extension of UC16: Deliver document via Online Distribution Platform
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UC7}: Filter documents in Personal Document Store}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary actor:} Registered Recipient

    \begin{enumerate}
       \item The user indicates he wants to pose a filter query to the Personal Document Store
       \item The user receives a form with filter choices, which he completes, and indicates he wants to filter with given parameters.
       \item The System retrieves all documents of the Registered User matching his query.
       \item The System provides an overview of all retrieved documents matching the User's query.
    \end{enumerate}

        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Postconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Representative has received Delivery information regarding the documents he is interested in.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Main scenario:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item The Representative signals he wants an overview of the company documents to which he has access (see remarks).
       \item The System retrieves all documents managed by the Representative.
       \item The System presents the Representative with an overview of the matching documents, including a small individual note per document whether it has been delivered or not.
       \item The use case ends here.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [4a.] The Representative indicates he wants to see details (see remarks) of a document present in the overview.
        \item [5a.] The System presents the Representative with the detailed information for indicated document.
        \item [4b.] The Representative indicates he only wants to see undelivered documents.
        \item [5b.] The System retrieves all undelivered documents managed by the Representative.
        \item [6b.] The System presents the Representative with an overview of the retrieved documents.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Remarks:}
        \begin{itemize}

            \item A document in an online distribution platform is only flagged as delivered after the document has also been opened by the Recipient.
            \item Details of a document in this Use Case denote for example the chosen distribution channel, the contents of the document, the date of generation \ldots
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UC9}: Submit Raw Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary actor:} Customer Organisation or Social Secretary or Customer Organization Representative
    \item \textbf{Interested parties:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Customer Organisation Representative:} wants to make sure the documents he manages are correctly generated and delivered from the raw data
            \item \textit{eDocs:} wants the system to correctly handle raw data or signal the company if errors exist
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Preconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The primary actor is authenticated (UC1).
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Postconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The System has received a correct batch of data which can be processed into docuents.
            \item The Customer Organisation knows that no errors are present in the currently submitted data.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Main scenario:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item The primary actor submits over agreed protocol a batch of raw data for processing.
       \item The System verifies that the raw data entries are all correctly formatted.
       \item The Use Case ends here.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [3a.] The System finds one or more entries in the raw data which are not correctly formatted.
        \item [4a.] The System collects all incorrect entries.
        \item [5a.] The System sends a notice to the responsible Customer Organisation Representative(s) that errors have been found in recently submitted data.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Remarks:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Customer Organisation as specified in the primary actors can mean a specific user periodically submitting data batches, but is mostly implied to be an automated system in the company, handling the batches of raw data. Analogous for the Social Secretary.
            \item Authentication of the primary actor can be through an interactive login procedure, but could also be automated authentication for the company systems, so they can automatically and periodically submit accumulated batches of raw data without user intervention.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UC10}: Handle Raw Data error}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary actor:} Customer Organisation Representative
    \item \textbf{Interested parties:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Customer Organisation:} wants to make sure its documents are correctly generated and delivered
            \item \textit{Social Secretary:} wants know if errors existed in the data they submitted, to check if their bookkeeping is sound.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Preconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The System has received a batch of raw data and found errors in the entries
            \item The System has sent a notice to the responsible Customer Organisation Representative.
            \item The Customer Organisation Representative as primary actor is responsible for the document type for which an error was present in the raw data.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Postconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The System has received new raw data to replace the data entries which contained errors.
            \item No new errors are present in the newly submitted raw data entries.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Main scenario:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item The Representative receives a notice that errors were present in a recently submitted raw data batch.
       \item The Representative logs in to the system (UC1).
       \item The Representative indicates he wants to receive an overview of the data errors to be handled by him/her.
       \item The System collects all raw data errors for which the Representative is responsible.
       \item The System presents the Representative with an overview of retrieved errors.
       \item the Representative gathers the correct data.
       \item The Representative submits over agreed protocol the new batch of raw data for processing.
       \item The System checks the new raw data for errors.
       \item No errors are found and the system indicates to the Representative that his submission was succesful.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [9a.] Errors are detected in the newly submitted data.
        \item [10a.] The System sends a notice to the responsible Customer Organisation Representative(s) that errors have been found in recently submitted data.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Remarks:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Abstraction is made of the way the Representative receives the notification. This could be by email or an external notification system of the company or eDocs. In this case the Log-In step is necessary. If the notice is internal to the eDocs system, and the Representative only receives it after logging in, the Log-In (UC1) step becomes a precondition.
            \item The agreed protocol for submission by the Representative should include a way to signal that the submitted raw data replaces erronous data. It could be a more interactive way of submitting data, for example, a field or button in the overview of the retrieved errors.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UC11}: Handle E-mail delivery error}
\begin{itemize}

            \item \textit{Recepient:} wants to receive his/her documents
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Preconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A document has been sent to the Recipient via e-mail, but was not delivered.
            \item The Recipient's email address in the Customer Organisation's database is wrong and not an existing e-mail address.
            \item The External E-mail Provider has sent a notice to the System that certain documents could not reach their destination.
            \item The System has notified the Representative of the fact that certain documents under his responsibility could not reach their destination.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Postconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The document has been sent to the Recipient via e-mail, and has been delivered.
            \item The Recipient's email address in the Customer Organisation's database is correct.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item \textbf{Main scenario:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item The Representative receives a notice that certain documents under his responsibility could not reach their destination.
       \item The Representative logs in to the system (UC1).

       \item The System resends the document with the newly supplied e-mail address.
       \item The Representative indicates he is done supplying correct e-mail addresses.
       \item The Use Case ends here.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:} 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [8a.] The Representative indicates he wants to supply a correct e-mail address to another document.
        \item [9a.] The Use Case resumes from step 4.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Remarks:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Abstraction is made of the way the Representative receives the notification. This could be by email or an external notification system of the company or eDocs. In this case the Log-In step is necessary. If the notice is internal to the eDocs system, and the Representative only receives it after logging in, the Log-In (UC1) step becomes a precondition.
            \item The gathering of correct e-mail addresses is implied as human interaction.
            \item The fact that the Customer Organisation database is updated with the correct e-mail address is implied as human interaction.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UC12}: Unregister from Personal Document Store}

        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Postconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Recipient is now an Unregistered Recipient.
            \item The details of the Recipient are removed from the System.
            \item The Recipient is logged out.
        \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UC13}: Deliver generated document}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary actor:} Recipient
    \item \textbf{Interested parties:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{eDocs:} wants documents to be delivered with as little human interaction as possible
            \item \textit{Customer Organization:} wants their documents to be delivered
            \item \textit{Customer Organization Representative:} want to have a clear and detailed overview of the status of their document processing jobs
        \end{itemize}
