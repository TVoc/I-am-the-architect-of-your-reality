       \item The user indicates he wants to pose a filter query to the Personal Document Store
       \item The user receives a form with filter choices, which he completes, and indicates he wants to filter with given parameters.

		\item [3a.] The System has determined that the identifying information does not allow the Recipient to be successfully identified (e.g. the Online Distribution Platform distributes invoices and the bank account number was not formatted correctly or no bank account number was supplied at all)
		\item [4a.] This anomaly is logged for review by an eDocs System Administrator
		\item [5a.] The use case ends
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Remarks:}
	\begin{itemize}
		None
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UC22}: Register Recipient unregistration with Online Distribution Platform}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Primary actor:} Online Distribution Platform
	\item \textbf{Interested parties:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{eDocs:} wishes to comply to the Recipient's preferences as to how he wants his documents to be delivered
		\item \textit{Recipient:} wants documents addressed to him to be delivered according to his wishes
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Preconditions:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Recipient has been registered as associated with the Online Distribution Platform
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Postconditions:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The System has logged that any overrides pertaining to document types distributed by the Online Distribution Platform no longer apply in the Recipient's case
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Main scenario:} 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Online Distribution Platform has indicated that they no longer service the Recipient
		\item The Online Distribution Platform supplies identifying information pertaining to the Recipient
		\item The System removes any overrides pertaining to document types distributed by the Online Distribution Platform
		\item The use case ends
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:} 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [3a.] The System has determined that the identifying information fails to successfully identify the Recipient
		\item [4a.] This anomaly is logged for review by an eDocs System Administrator
		\item [5a.] The use case ends
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Remarks:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First remark

\section{Non-functional requirements}\label{sec:non-functional}
In this section, we model the non-functional requirements for the system in the
form of \emph{quality attribute scenarios}. We provide for each type
(availability, performance and modifiability) one requirement.

\subsection{Availability}
\subsubsection{\emph{Av1}: Name of the quality attribute scenario}
Shortly describe the context of the scenario.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source:} source
    \item \textbf{Stimulus:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Description of a first stimulus.
            \item Description of a second stimulus.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Artifact:} the stimulated artifact
    \item \textbf{Environment:} the condition under which the stimulus occurs
    \item \textbf{Response:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe how the system should respond to the stimulus.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Response measure:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe how the satisfaction of a response is measured.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\subsubsection{\emph{P1}: Name of the quality attribute scenario}
Shortly describe the context of the scenario.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source:} source
    \item \textbf{Stimulus:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Description of a first stimulus.
            \item Description of a second stimulus.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Artifact:} the stimulated artifact
    \item \textbf{Environment:} the condition under which the stimulus occurs
    \item \textbf{Response:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe how the system should respond to the stimulus.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Response measure:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe how the satisfaction of a response is measured.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modifiability}
\subsubsection{\emph{M1}: Name of the quality attribute scenario}
Shortly describe the context of the scenario.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source:} source
    \item \textbf{Stimulus:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Description of a first stimulus.
            \item Description of a second stimulus.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Artifact:} the stimulated artifact
    \item \textbf{Environment:} the condition under which the stimulus occurs
    \item \textbf{Response:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe how the system should respond to the stimulus.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Response measure:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe how the satisfaction of a response is measured.
        \end{itemize}
