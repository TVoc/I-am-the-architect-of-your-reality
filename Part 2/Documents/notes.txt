First run:
Av1 (H) + P1 (H)
UC: 4, 5

Av1:
"System is able to autonomously detect..."
--> Fault detection:
Heartbeat, piggybacking on generated documents. If no documents have been generated for a set time, the generation module will send a heartbeat signal to the listener at set intervals.

Statistics module: accomodate dynamic data batches and predict future "unplanned" loads

Scheduler module: accomodates recurring data batches and signals the system when to prepare for planned heavier loads on the system

Raw data pool: Storage pool for unprocessed raw data. Raw data is pulled form this pool and signalled when processed. This pull-behaviour makes scaling the performance of the system easier.

Other choices:
Av2 (H) + P2 (M)
