Figure \ref{fig:depl_context} shows the Context Diagram for the deployment of the system.\\
The \ttt{SubmissionSubsystem} is contacted for Raw Data Submission over FTP, SCP, etc. as stipulated in the SLA (conform the initial description). It also connects to an \ttt{InformationBroker} over HTTP to lookup information for consistency checks of Raw Data.\\
The different types of UI's (the \ttt{RecipientUI}, \ttt{COAdminUI} and \ttt{eDocsAdminUI}) connect to the UIFacade through the HTTP protocol, be it via a web browser or a user application. The response from a user's session is delivered back by the UIFacade (more precisely by the session of the user on the serverside) over the same protocol.\\
The \ttt{DeliveryChannels} send documents to their respective services over the protocol as stipulated by the service (FTP,SCP,...).\\
Nodes from the \ttt{CommunicationSubsystem} use SMTP to send e-mails via the \ttt{E-mailSubmissionSystem}, and the \ttt{ExternalNotificationAcceptor} also receives messages over SMTP from e.g. Zoomit or the e-mail provider (in case of failures, deliveries...).\\
The \ttt{BillingSubsystem} interfaces with an external billing system of the eDocs company through a general (FTP,SCP...) protocol to process billing to Customer Organisations.

Figure \ref{fig:depl_primary} presents the primary deployment of the internal architecture. All components for which no special deployment requirements were found are deployed on a general \ttt{OtherFunctionalityNode}.\\
The \ttt{Generator}s are deployed on dedicated \ttt{GeneratorNode}s as given. These connect to the \ttt{GeneratedDocumentHandler}, deployed on its own dedicated node. The reason for this being that this \ttt{Handler} can be a bottleneck in the system, since all generated documents pass through it. This way, a powerful node can be instated for this function, so it does not slow down the finalisation of documents by the \ttt{Generator}s (\emph{P1}).\\
The \ttt{GeneratedDocumentHandlerNode} connects back to the \ttt{OtherFunctionalityNode} for delivery purposes, but the \ttt{DocumentStorageHandler} component on it also connects to both \ttt{DBManagerNode}s for storage purposes. This \ttt{DocumentStorageHandler} is hosted on the same node as the \ttt{GeneratedDocumentHandler} to lower the layers of indirection and boost performance.\\
The setup of the \ttt{PDSDB} nodes is the same as initially given, with the \ttt{PDSDBManagerNode} connecting to the \ttt{OtherFunctionalityNode} for various purposes, e.g. reporting \ttt{PDSDBReplica} failures, receive notice that stored documents should be moved to the \ttt{PDSDBReplicaDeliveredNode} etc.
Analogous to the \ttt{PDSDB}, the \ttt{DocumentDB} is deployed as a \ttt{DocumentDBManagerNode} and multiple \ttt{DocumentDBReplicaNode}s. This setup conforms to the active replication we set up for \emph{Av2} (e.g. filling the \ttt{PDSDB} after coming back online warrants a decent replication of the \ttt{DocumentDB}), but most importantly for performance sake by the use of sharding, for e.g. the aforementioned filling of the pds, while also storing new documents and simultaneously serving lookup requests (\emph{P2}).\\
Likewise, the components of the \ttt{LookupSubsystem} are deployed on their own respective nodes to suit \emph{P2} and connect to the necessary nodes for lookup.\\
The \ttt{JobStatusDatabase} is deployed on its own node for \emph{P3}, being the single important component for this requirement.\\
The \ttt{ErrorEmailDeliveryHandler} is also deployed individually, playing a crucial role in \emph{Av1a} and \emph{Av2a}.
