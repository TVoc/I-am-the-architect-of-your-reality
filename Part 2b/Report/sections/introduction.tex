\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The goal of this project was to design an architecture for a Document Processing system. Companies can use this system to submit data for payslips and invoices, and the corresponding documents are generated and delivered for them. This way, they do not have to provide the infrastructure for this themselves. The architecture as developed and explained in the following sections conforms to the functional and non-functional requirements as imposed by the assignment.
